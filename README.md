# NBA Clutch Timeouts

I just finished watching game 2 of the 2023 NBA Finals where Jamal Murray ended up missing the game tying shot:

As with any passionate fan, the response to the ending of this game was to question the coaches descion because us fans know better. 
Many basketball fans argued that you should be taking a timeout to draw up a play instead getting the ball to your star and have him heave up a prayer.
This got me thinking, why don't I just look and see if it's a good idea to call a timeout in that scenario.

## Data

The play by play data was scraped from BasketballReference. It contains every game from the last 5 years (2019-2023)

## Does calling a timeout usually increase offensive production?

To examine the effectiveness of calling a timeout to draw up a play, I strictly looked at the points per possession. A possession only ends once the other
team gets the ball, so when an offensive rebound or free throws occur it is still apart of the possession. Coming out of timeout teams are more likely to not score

Points per Possession after taking a timeout:

Points per Possession without a timeout:

## Points per Possession within 5 - 15 seconds

Points per Possession after timeout: 0.4115138592750533

Points per Possession with no timeout: 0.5310734463276836
